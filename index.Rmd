# This is Jacquelyn's awesome website

Jacquelyn Fusco is an administrative assistant who studied Political

Science and Sociology. Fusco is a leftist, a Democratic Socialist, and

an Intersectional Feminist. Fusco has been using interpersonal skills

to build morale and improve the well-being of every team she has ever

been on. Whether training new employees or leading by example as a

volunteer, Fusco has a calm demeanor and candor that puts others at

ease while marking a path forward for her peers.



Fusco has dedicated her career to improving living conditions for

others. The first-generation college graduate continues to learn what

ails the world and define solutions to relieve suffering. Fusco

superbly organizes information to provide deeply meaningful context

that clarifies her objectives regardless of the task at hand.

Following her passion for service to her community, she applied to and

accepted an invitation to attend CUNY Baruchâ€™s Master of Public

Administration program.



At every step Ms. Fusco has solidified her commitment to working in an

organization with a mission committed to a bottom line of social

equity, environmental justice, and economic justice. As far back as

grade school, Ms. Fusco has made herself a champion of the underdogs,

even if that underdog was herself. She became a first-generation

college graduate and continued on to graduate school, surpassing every

expectation. It has been a personal mission to educate herself and

fill in the blanks that grade school and mainstream media left by

reading 50 books every year.



Fusco is currently looking for an opportunity that combines her

activism around political issues and state-level legislation with her

professional experience in the nonprofit sector. In the future, Fusco

hopes to coordinate and manage day-to-day tasks for a nonprofit with a

mission she believes in.
